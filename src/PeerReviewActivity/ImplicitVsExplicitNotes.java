//    Implicit vs. Explicit Casting
//
//    A Type Casting in Java is used to convert objects or variables of one type into another. When we are converting or assigning one data type to another they might not be compatible. Type Casting in Java is  nothing but converting a primitive or interface or class in Java into other type.
//
//    An implicit type conversion is automatically performed by the compiler when differing data types are intermixed in an expression. An explicit type conversion is user-defined conversion that forces an expression to be of specific type. An implicit type conversion is performed without programmer's intervention.
//
//    Widening Casting (Implicit) – Automatic Type Conversion
//
//    Widening Casting (Implicit) takes place when two types are compatible and the target type is larger than the source type.
//
//    Narrowing Casting (Explicit) – Need Explicit Conversion
//
//    Narrowing Casting (Explicit): When we are assigning a larger type to a smaller type, Explicit Casting is required.
